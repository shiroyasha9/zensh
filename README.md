# Zensh

This is my zsh configuration (thanks to [Dreams of Autonomy](https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy/zensh) for the base file).

This configuration prioritizes zen and calm in order to reduce distractions and 
maintain momentum when working inside of the terminal.

Also, adds vim support, btw.
