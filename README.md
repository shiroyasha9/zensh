# Zensh

This is my zsh configuration (thanks to [Dreams of Autonomy](https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy/zensh) for the base file).

This configuration prioritizes zen and calm in order to reduce distractions and 
maintain momentum when working inside of the terminal.

Also, adds vim support, btw. 

Install https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck to use `fuck` to autocorrect your commands.
